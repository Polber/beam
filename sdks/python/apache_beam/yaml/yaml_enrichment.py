    The Enrichment transform allows you to dynamically 
    enhance elements in a pipeline by performing key-value 
    lookups against external services like APIs or databases. 

    Args:
        enrichment_handler: Specifies the source from 
            where data needs to be extracted
            into the pipeline for enriching data. 
            It can be a string value in ["BigQuery", 
            "BigTable", "FeastFeatureStore", 
            "VertexAIFeatureStore"].
        handler_config: Specifies the parameters for 
            the respective enrichment_handler in a dictionary format.
